# Do you have a pet project?
I do, and I don't like the fact that I've abandoned most of them before finishing.
My current pet project helps me collect interesting materials and organize them by relevance. This is very useful, and I don't want it to remain unfinished.

# How do you collect your ideas?
In my case, I needed a commitment. A simple `todo.md` file committed to my repo worked quite well.
It's a good start, but it has its limitations and, honestly, it's not very creative.
So I decided to switch to Jupyter notebooks. First, they allow for ad-hoc calculations; second, they support Markdown.
I created a list of milestones like this:

```markdown
### Oh-my-reading-list next steps
- Switch post embeddings model
- Implement data fetcher for MDN blog
- Implement data fetcher for developer.chrome.com blog
- Implement data fetcher for web.dev
- Implement data fetcher for Evil Martians blog
- Update rec model to never ever suggest vibecoding articles
- Add implement quick summary for the articles
```

When I have a spare hour, what should I pick? I stared at the list, thinking deeply, and _after an hour_ finally selected the best item...

Try two: I ordered the list once and tried to go step-by-step. I picked the first task, worked on it for an hour, but didn't finish. After a few days, I'd forgotten all the context and had to start over.
And again, and again...

Clearly, I need to reorder my tasks. I decided to assign two extra numbers to each task:
1. coolness - how cool my project becomes after implementing this task (in sunglasses)
2. complexity - how complex this task is (in penguins)

Unlike real-life projects, it's totally fine to convert penguins to hours here, since I'm not interacting with other people :)
So, one hour equals 5 penguins. What should I pick next? The answer is simple: estimate your spare hours for the next week and solve the
[knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

```javascript
const readingList = [
    { title: "Implement data fetcher for developer.chrome.com blog", coolness:
5, complexity: 1 },
    { title: "Implement data fetcher for web.dev", coolness: 5, complexity: 1 },
    { title: "Implement data fetcher for MDN blog", coolness: 5, complexity: 1 },
    { title: "Implement data fetcher for Evil Martians blog", coolness: 5, complexity: 1 },
    { title: "Update rec model to never ever suggest vibecoding articles", coolness: 10, complexity: 25 },
    { title: "Add implement quick summary for the articles", coolness: 3, complexity: 10 },
    { title: "Switch post embeddings model", coolness: 10, complexity: 25 }
];

const spareHours = 3;

const knapsack = (items, capacity) => {
    const n = items.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(capacity + 1).fill(0));

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let w = 0; w <= capacity; w++) {
            if (items[i - 1].complexity <= w) {
                dp[i][w] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - items[i - 1].complexity] + items[i - 1].coolness);
            } else {
                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];
            }
        }
    }

    const result = [];
    let w = capacity;
    for (let i = n; i > 0 && w > 0; i--) {
        if (dp[i][w] !== dp[i - 1][w]) {
            result.push(items[i - 1]);
            w -= items[i - 1].complexity;
        }
    }
    return result.reverse();
};

const selectedTasks = knapsack(readingList, spareHours * 5);
console.log("Selected tasks for the week:", selectedTasks);
```

The output will be:

```javascript
Selected tasks for the week:
[
    {title: 'Implement data fetcher for developer.chrome.com blog', coolness: 5, complexity: 1},
    {title: 'Implement data fetcher for web.dev', coolness: 5, complexity: 1},
    {title: 'Implement data fetcher for MDN blog', coolness: 5, complexity: 1},
    {title: 'Implement data fetcher for Evil Martians blog', coolness: 5, complexity: 1},
    {title: 'Add implement quick summary for the articles', coolness: 3, complexity: 10}
]
```

Alternatively I can sort the tasks by efficiency and pick the most efficient ones:

```javascript
const sortedTasks = readingList.sort((a, b) => (b.coolness / b.complexity) - (a.coolness / a.complexity));
console.log("Selected tasks one by one:", sortedTasks);
```

I can also visualize the tasks in 2D space. This helps me to find the most effective tasks and understand the overall design of my project.
The steeper the curve the better!

# Conclusion
Sometimes adding a bit of data in unexpected places turns out to be useful, however be aware. I spent an hour writing this post. Guess how many tasks for my pet project I've finished? ;)
