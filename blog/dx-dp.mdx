### Introduction

I originally wanted to write a single post about productivity, mostly because developer tooling has changed a lot over the last couple of years - and my own workflow has changed with it.

Along the way I collected a bunch of small tricks (and a few painful lessons). Some I learned the hard way, some I stole from friends and community folks, and some appeared only after I broke my setup for the third time and had to rebuild it from scratch.

At first I thought I would interview a few people and put everything into one big longread. I still like longreads, but I will break things down: a little self-reflection, a few formulas, and small, readable portions.

This series is a mix of my own experiments, mistakes, and opinions - plus lessons I have picked up from the developer community around me. I will reference different workflows, quotes, and trade-offs (with context), because productivity is rarely one-size-fits-all.

What we are going to cover, gradually:

1. What 'productivity' and 'developer efficiency' mean from different perspectives, and how people actually measure them
1. Software tooling and workflows (editors, automation, testing, CI, personal systems)
1. Hardware, ergonomics, and the physical setup that quietly affects work
